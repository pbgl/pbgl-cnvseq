PBGL - CNVseq
==============

This repository provides a reproducible copy-number-analysis tool through the use of Jupyter Notebooks to detect copy number variations (CNVs). The methods used to calculate the CNVs are described in this paper:

The original functions inside **pbgl-cnvseq/tool/helper-functions/cnvHLiang.R** were downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/hliang/cnv-seq">hliang/cnv-seq</a> Github repository.


Helper functions under the **Bioconductor Helper Functions** section inside the file **pbgl-cnvseq/tool/helper-functions/RCNV_seq-helper.R** were taken from <a href="https://github.com/Bioconductor/copy-number-analysis">Bioconductor's copy-number-analysis</a> Github repository.

Additional helper functions developed by PBGL can also be found under the **PBGL Helper Functions** section inside the file **pbgl-cnvseq/tool/helper-functions/RCNV_seq-helper.R**.
